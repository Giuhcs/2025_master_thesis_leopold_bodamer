abstract = {We derive Markovian master equations for single and interacting harmonic systems in different scenarios, including strong internal coupling. By comparing the dynamics resulting from the corresponding master equations with numerical simulations of the global system's evolution, we delimit their validity regimes and assess the robustness of the assumptions usually made in the process of deriving the reduced Markovian dynamics. The results of these illustrative examples serve to clarify the general properties of other open quantum system scenarios subject to treatment within a Markovian approximation.}

    abstract = {Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2D-ES) has become an important technique for studying energy transfer, electronic coupling, and electronic–vibrational coherence in the past ten years. However, since 2D-ES is not interface specific, the electronic information at surfaces and interfaces could not be demonstrated clearly. Two-dimensional electronic sum-frequency generation (2D-ESFG) is an emerging spectroscopic technique that explores the correlations between different interfacial electronic transitions and is the extension of 2D-ES to surface and interfacial specificity. In this work, we present the detailed development and implementation of phase-cycling 2D-ESFG spectroscopy using an acousto-optic pulse shaper in a pump–probe geometry. With the pulse pair generated by a pulse shaper rather than optical devices based on birefringence or interference, this 2D-ESFG setup enables rapid scanning, phase cycling, and the separation of rephasing and nonrephasing signals. In addition, by collecting data in a rotating frame, we greatly improve experimental efficiency. We demonstrate the method for azo-derivative molecules at the air/water interface. This method could be readily extended to different interfaces and surfaces. The unique phase-cycling 2D-ESFG technique enables one to quantify the energy transfer, charge transfer, electronic coupling, and many other electronic properties and dynamics at surfaces and interfaces with precision and relative ease of use. Our goal in this article is to present the fine details of the fourth-order nonlinear optical technique in a manner that is comprehensive, succinct, and approachable such that other researchers can implement, improve, and adapt it to probe unique and innovative problems to advance the field.},

    abstract = {The recent development of multidimensional ultrafast spectroscopy techniques calls for the introduction of computational schemes that allow for the simulation of such experiments and the interpretation of the corresponding results from a microscopic point of view. In this work, we present a general and efficient first-principles scheme to compute two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy maps based on real-time time-dependent density-functional theory. The interface of this approach with the Ehrenfest scheme for molecular dynamics enables the inclusion of vibronic effects in the calculations based on a classical treatment of the nuclei. The computational complexity of the simulations is reduced by the application of numerical advances such as branching techniques, undersampling, and a novel reduced phase cycling scheme, applicable for systems with inversion symmetry. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by applying it to prototypical molecules such as benzene, pyridine, and pyrene. We discuss the role of the approximations that inevitably enter the adopted theoretical framework and set the stage for further extensions of the proposed method to more realistic systems.},

  abstract  = {We introduce the basic concepts of two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) and a general theoretical framework adopted to calculate, from first principles, the nonlinear response of multi-chromophoric systems in realistic environments. Specifically, we focus on UV-active chromophores representing the building blocks of biological systems, from proteins to nucleic acids, describing our progress in developing computational tools and protocols for accurate simulation of their 2DUV spectra. The roadmap for accurate 2DUV spectroscopy simulations is illustrated starting with benchmarking of the excited-state manifold of the chromophoric units in a vacuum, which can be used for building exciton Hamiltonians for large-scale applications or as a reference for first-principles simulations with reduced computational cost, enabling treatment of minimal (still realistic) multi-chromophoric model systems. By adopting a static approximation that neglects dynamic processes such as spectral diffusion and population transfer, we show how 2DUV is able to characterize the ground-state conformational space of dinucleosides and small peptides comprising dimeric chromophoric units (in their native environment) by tracking inter-chromophoric electronic couplings. Recovering the excited-state coherent vibrational dynamics and population transfers, we observe a remarkable agreement between the predicted 2DUV spectra of the pyrene molecule and the experimental results. These results further led to theoretical studies of the excited-state dynamics in a solvated dinucleoside system, showing that spectroscopic fingerprints of long-lived excited-state minima along the complex photoinduced decay pathways of DNA/RNA model systems can be simulated at a reasonable computational cost. Our results exemplify the impact of accurate simulation of 2DES spectra in revealing complex physicochemical properties of fundamental biological systems and should trigger further theoretical developments as well as new experiments.}

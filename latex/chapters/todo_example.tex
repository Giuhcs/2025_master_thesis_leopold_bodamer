\section{Using Todo Notes}

\noindent Here's an example paragraph with various todo notes embedded. The Fourier transform is a mathematical transform that decomposes a function into its constituent frequencies. \todoimp{Complete this explanation with the formal definition!}

\noindent When discussing the Hamiltonian of a quantum system, we typically write it as:
\begin{equation}
    H = H_0 + H_{\text{int}}
\end{equation}

\todoeq{Add the interaction terms explicitly}

\noindent The spectroscopic signals in 2D spectroscopy contain peaks along the diagonal corresponding to the linear absorption spectrum. \todoref{Add reference to Mukamel's work}

\noindent In the phase-matching conditions section we could \todoidea{Add a diagram illustrating the k-vector directions in FWM experiments}

\noindent The derivation of the optical Bloch equations needs \todofix{Fix the coherence evolution equation - sign error in the term involving $\rho_{21}$}

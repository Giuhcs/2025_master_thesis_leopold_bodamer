	abstract = {Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2D-{ES}) has become an important technique for studying energy transfer, electronic coupling, and electronic–vibrational coherence in the past ten years. However, since 2D-{ES} is not interface specific, the electronic information at surfaces and interfaces could not be demonstrated clearly. Two-dimensional electronic sum-frequency generation (2D-{ESFG}) is an emerging spectroscopic technique that explores the correlations between different interfacial electronic transitions and is the extension of 2D-{ES} to surface and interfacial specificity. In this work, we present the detailed development and implementation of phase-cycling 2D-{ESFG} spectroscopy using an acousto-optic pulse shaper in a pump–probe geometry. With the pulse pair generated by a pulse shaper rather than optical devices based on birefringence or interference, this 2D-{ESFG} setup enables rapid scanning, phase cycling, and the separation of rephasing and nonrephasing signals. In addition, by collecting data in a rotating frame, we greatly improve experimental efficiency. We demonstrate the method for azo-derivative molecules at the air/water interface. This method could be readily extended to different interfaces and surfaces. The unique phase-cycling 2D-{ESFG} technique enables one to quantify the energy transfer, charge transfer, electronic coupling, and many other electronic properties and dynamics at surfaces and interfaces with precision and relative ease of use. Our goal in this article is to present the fine details of the fourth-order nonlinear optical technique in a manner that is comprehensive, succinct, and approachable such that other researchers can implement, improve, and adapt it to probe unique and innovative problems to advance the field.},

	abstract = {We introduce the basic concepts of two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) and a general theoretical framework adopted to calculate, from first principles, the nonlinear response of multi-chromophoric systems in realistic environments. Specifically, we focus on {UV}-active chromophores representing the building blocks of biological systems, from proteins to nucleic acids, describing our progress in developing computational tools and protocols for accurate simulation of their 2DUV spectra. The roadmap for accurate 2DUV spectroscopy simulations is illustrated starting with benchmarking of the excited-state manifold of the chromophoric units in a vacuum, which can be used for building exciton Hamiltonians for large-scale applications or as a reference for first-principles simulations with reduced computational cost, enabling treatment of minimal (still realistic) multi-chromophoric model systems. By adopting a static approximation that neglects dynamic processes such as spectral diffusion and population transfer, we show how 2DUV is able to characterize the ground-state conformational space of dinucleosides and small peptides comprising dimeric chromophoric units (in their native environment) by tracking inter-chromophoric electronic couplings. Recovering the excited-state coherent vibrational dynamics and population transfers, we observe a remarkable agreement between the predicted 2DUV spectra of the pyrene molecule and the experimental results. These results further led to theoretical studies of the excited-state dynamics in a solvated dinucleoside system, showing that spectroscopic fingerprints of long-lived excited-state minima along the complex photoinduced decay pathways of {DNA}/{RNA} model systems can be simulated at a reasonable computational cost. Our results exemplify the impact of accurate simulation of 2DES spectra in revealing complex physicochemical properties of fundamental biological systems and should trigger further theoretical developments as well as new experiments.},

An optical cavity is another optically resonant system where the loss from the cavity determines the resonant optical response of the system. The near resonant combination of an optical Fabry-Pérot cavity with laser cooled and trapped atoms couples two distinct optical resonators via light and has great potential for precision measurements and the creation of versatile quantum optics systems. Here we show how driven magneto-optically trapped atoms in collective strong coupling regime with the cavity leads to lasing at a frequency red detuned from the atomic transition. Lasing is demonstrated experimentally by the observation of a lasing threshold accompanied by polarization and spatial mode purity, and line-narrowing in the outcoupled light. Spontaneous emission into the cavity mode by the driven atoms stimulates lasing action, which is capable of operating as a continuous wave laser in steady state, without a seed laser. The system is modeled theoretically, and qualitative agreement with experimentally observed lasing is seen. Our result opens up a range of new measurement possibilities with this system.},

The system-field interaction is treated nonperturbatively in the semiclassical dipole approximation, enabling a calculation of third order nonlinear spectroscopic signals directly from molecular dynamics and an efficient modeling of multilevel systems exhibiting relaxation and transfer phenomena. The method, coupled with the treatment of dynamics within the Bloch model, is illustrated by calculations of the two-dimensional three-pulse photon echo spectra of a simple model system—a two-electronic-level molecule. The nonperturbative calculations reproduce well-known results obtained by perturbative methods. Technical limitations of the nonperturbative approach in dealing with a dynamic inhomogeneity are discussed, and possible solutions are suggested.

The manner in which the two-dimensional spectra reveal electronic couplings in the aggregate system and the evolution of the spectra in time is studied in detail. Changes in the intensity and shape of the peaks in the two-dimensional relaxation spectra are related to the coherent and dissipative dynamics of the system. It is shown that coherent electronic motion, an electronic analog of a vibrational wave packet, can manifest itself in two-dimensional optical spectra of molecular aggregate systems as a periodic modulation of both the diagonal and off-diagonal peaks.},

In this work, we present a general and efficient first-principles scheme to compute two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy maps based on real-time time-dependent density-functional theory. The interface of this approach with the Ehrenfest scheme for molecular dynamics enables the inclusion of vibronic effects in the calculations based on a classical treatment of the nuclei. The computational complexity of the simulations is reduced by the application of numerical advances such as branching techniques, undersampling, and a novel reduced phase cycling scheme, applicable for systems with inversion symmetry. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by applying it to prototypical molecules such as benzene, pyridine, and pyrene. We discuss the role of the approximations that inevitably enter the adopted theoretical framework and set the stage for further extensions of the proposed method to more realistic systems.},

Here we review the power of symmetry as a resource to manipulate quantum transport, and apply these ideas to engineer novel quantum devices. Using tools from open quantum systems and large deviation theory, we show that symmetry-mediated control of transport is enabled by a pair of twin dynamic phase transitions in current statistics, accompanied by a coexistence of diﬀerent transport channels. By playing with the symmetry decomposition of the initial state, one can modulate the importance of the diﬀerent transport channels and hence control the ﬂowing current. Motivated by the problem of energy harvesting we illustrate these ideas in open quantum networks, an analysis which leads to the design of a symmetry-controlled quantum thermal switch. We review an experimental setup recently proposed for symmetry-mediated quantum control in the lab based on a linear array of atom-doped optical cavities, and the possibility of using transport as a probe to uncover hidden symmetries, as recently demonstrated in molecular junctions, is also discussed. Other symmetry-mediated control mechanisms are also described. Overall, these results demonstrate the importance of symmetry not only as a organizing principle in physics but also as a tool to control quantum systems.},

This paper explores the experimental and the theoretical antecedents of Fo¨rster’s theory of resonance energy transfer ({FRET}). Early studies of sensitized ﬂuorescence, ﬂuorescence depolarization, and photosynthesis demonstrated the phenomena of long-range energy transfer. At the same time physicists developed theoretical models which contained common physical mechanisms and parameters: oscillating dipoles as models for the atoms or molecules, dipole-dipole coupling for the interaction, and a distance R0 that is optimal for resonance energy transfer. Early theories predicted R0 that was too large as compared to experiments. Finally, in 1946 F¨orster developed a classical theory and in 1948 he developed a quantum mechanical theory; both theories predicted an inverse sixth power dependence of the rate of energy transfer and a R0 that agreed with experiments. This paper attempts to determine why Fo¨rster succeeded when the other theoreticians failed to develop the correct theory. The putative roles of interdisciplinary education and collaborative research are discussed. Furthermore, I explore the role of science journals and their speciﬁc audiences in the popularization of {FRET} to a broad interdisciplinary community.},

We ﬁnd that the autocorrelation function in the Green-Kubo formula decays as ∼ t−1.5 to a ﬁnite value which vanishes rapidly with the increase of the system size. As a result, the Green-Kubo formula converges to a ﬁnite value in the thermodynamic limit. These facts strongly support the realization of Fourier heat law in a quantum system.},

            We theoretically investigate the super- and sub-radiance from the resonant dipole-dipole interactions ({RDDI}) in a confined two-dimensional (2D) reservoir. The distinctive feature of 2D {RDDI} shows qualitatively and quantitatively different long-range behavior from {RDDI} in free space. We investigate the collective radiation properties of the singly-excited symmetric state under this 2D {RDDI}. This state also allows subradiant decays in much longer distances than the transition wavelength, showing longrange atom-atom correlations. We further study the dynamics of the subradiant states which can be accessed by imprinting spatially dependent phases on the atomic arrays. Our results demonstrate rich opportunities in engineering light-matter interactions in a confined 2D reservoir, and hold promise in applications of quantum light storage and single-excitation state manipulations.},

	abstract = {The Jaynes-Cummings ({JC}) model has been at the forefront of quantum optics for almost six decades to date, providing one of the simplest yet intricately nonlinear formulations of light-matter interaction in modern physics. Laying most of the emphasis on the omnipresence of the model across a range of disciplines, this monograph brings up the fundamental generality of its formalism, looking at a wide gamut of applications in specific physical systems among several realms, including atomic physics, quantum optics, solid-state physics and quantum information science. When bringing the various pieces together to assemble our narrative, we have primarily targeted researchers in quantum physics and quantum optics. The monograph also comprises an accessible introduction for graduate students engaged with non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions, quantum computing and simulation, and quantum many-body physics. In that framework, we aim to reveal the common ground between physics and applications scattered across literature and different technological advancements. The exposition guides the reader through a vibrant field interlacing quantum optics and condensed-matter physics. All sections are devoted to the strong interconnection between theory and experiment, historically linked to the development of the various modern research directions stemming from {JC} physics. This is accompanied by a comprehensive list of references to the key publications that have shaped its evolution since the early 1960s. Finally, we have endeavored to keep the presentation of such a multi-sided material as concise as possible, interspersing continuous text with various illustrations alongside an economical use of mathematical expressions.},

The text begins with a review of relevant fundamental probability. It then covers gambling problems, random walks, and Markov chains. The authors go on to discuss random processes continuous in time, including Poisson, birth and death processes, and general population models, and present an extended discussion on the analysis of associated stationary processes in queues. 

The book also explores reliability and other random processes, such as branching, martingales, and simple epidemics. A new chapter describing Brownian motion, where the outcomes are continuously observed over continuous time, is included. Further applications, worked examples and problems, and biographical details have been added to this edition. Much of the text has been reworked. The appendix contains key results in probability for reference.
This concise, updated book makes the material accessible, highlighting simple applications and examples.

	abstract = {A theoretical analysis is carried out for the recently developed three-pulse photon echo spectroscopy employing dual frequency combs ({DFC}) as the light sources. In this method, the molecular sample interacts with three pulse trains derived from the {DFC} and the generated third-order signal is displayed as a two-dimensional (2D) spectrum that depends on the waiting time introduced by employing asynchronous optical sampling method. Through the analysis of the heterodyne-detected signal interferogram using a local oscillator derived from one of the optical frequency combs, we show that the 2D spectrum closely matches the spectrum expected from a conventional approach with four pulses derived from a single femtosecond laser pulse and the waiting time between the second and third field-matter interactions is given by the down-converted detection time of the interferogram. The theoretical result is applied to a two-level model system with solvation effect described by solvatochromic spectral density. The model 2D spectrum reproduces spectral features such as the loss of frequency correlation, dephasing, and spectral shift as a function of the population time. We anticipate that the present theory will be the general framework for quantitative descriptions of {DFC}-based nonlinear optical spectroscopy.},

We provide general theorems on the topology of photon-mediated interactions in terms of both Hermitian and non-Hermitian topological invariants, unveiling the phenomena of topological preservation and reversal, and revealing a system-bath topological correspondence. Depending on the Hermiticity of the environment and the parity of the spatial dimension, the atomic and photonic topological invariants turn out to be equal or opposite. Consequently, the emergence of atomic and photonic topological boundary modes with opposite group velocities in two-dimensional Hermitian topological systems is established.

When the number of atoms tends to infinity, this model can undergo a transition to a superradiant phase, belonging to the mean-field Ising universality class. The superradiant transition was first predicted for atoms in thermal equilibrium and was recently realized with a quantum simulator made of atoms in an optical cavity, subject to both dissipation and driving. In this Progress Report, we offer an introduction to some theoretical concepts relevant to the Dicke model, reviewing the critical properties of the superradiant phase transition, and the distinction between equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions. In addition, we explain the fundamental difference between the superradiant phase transition and the more common lasing transition. Our report mostly focuses on the steady states of atoms in single-mode optical cavities, but we also mention some aspects of real-time dynamics, as well as other quantum simulators, including superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and using spin-orbit coupling for cold atoms. These realizations differ in regard to whether they describe equilibrium or non-equilibrium systems.},

The usefulness of this method depends on the choice of the basis operator set. When the angular symmetries of the ensemble of interest are important it is convenient to expand ρ in terms of irreducible tensor operators. This method provides a well-developed and efficient way of using the inherent symmetry of the system. It also enables the consequences of angular momentum conservation to be simply allowed for and enables dynamical and geometrical factors in the equation of interest to be separated from each other.},

The crystalline order in a microtubule, with lattice constants short enough to allow energy transfer between amino acid chromophores, is similar to synthetic structures designed for light harvesting. After photoexcitation, can these amino acid chromophores transfer excitation energy along the microtubule like a natural or artificial light-harvesting system? Here, we use tryptophan autofluorescence lifetimes to probe energy hopping between aromatic residues in tubulin and microtubules. By studying how the quencher concentration alters tryptophan autofluorescence lifetimes, we demonstrate that electronic energy can diffuse over 6.6 nm in microtubules. We discover that while diffusion lengths are influenced by tubulin polymerization state (free tubulin versus tubulin in the microtubule lattice), they are not significantly altered by the average number of protofilaments (13 versus 14). We also demonstrate that the presence of the anesthetics etomidate and isoflurane reduce exciton diffusion. Energy transport as explained by conventional Förster theory (accommodating for interactions between tryptophan and tyrosine residues) does not sufficiently explain our observations. Our studies indicate that microtubules are, unexpectedly, effective light harvesters.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy is a powerful technique to study nuclear and electronic correlations between different transitions or initial and final states. Here we describe in detail our development of inherently phase-stabilized 2D Fourier-transform spectroscopy for electronic transitions. A diffractive-optic setup is used to realize heterodyne-detected femtosecond four-wave mixing in a phase-matched box geometry. Wavelength tunability in the visible range is accomplished by means of a 3 {kHz} repetition-rate laser system and optical parametric amplification. Nonlinear signals are fully characterized by spectral interferometry. Starting from fundamental principles, we discuss the origin of phase stability and the precise calibration of excitation-pulse time delays using movable glass wedges. Automated subtraction of undesired scattering terms removes experimental artifacts. On the theoretical side, the response-function formalism is extended to describe molecules with three electronic levels, and the shape of 2D spectral features is discussed. As an example for this technique, experimental 2D spectra are shown for the dye molecule Nile Blue in acetonitrile at 595 nm, recorded for a series of population times. Simulations explore the influence of different model parameters and qualitatively reproduce the experimental results. We show that correlations between different electronically excited states can be determined from the spectra. The technique described here can be used to measure the third-order response function of complex systems covering several electronic transitions.},

We found that electronic dephasing occurs within ∼60 fs and inhomogeneous broadening is approximately 120 cm–1. A three-dimensional global fit analysis allows us to identify several time scales in the dynamics of the 2D spectra ranging from 100 fs to ∼10 ps and to uncover the energy-transfer pathways in {LHCII}. In particular, the energy transfer between the chlorophyll b and chlorophyll a pools occurs within ∼1.1 ps. Retrieved 2D decay-associated spectra also uncover the spectral positions of corresponding diagonal peaks in the 2D spectra. Residuals in the decay traces exhibit periodic modulations with different oscillation periods. However, only one of them can be associated with the excitonic cross-peaks in the 2D spectrum, while the remaining ones are presumably of vibrational origin. For the interpretation of the spectroscopic data, we have applied a refined exciton model for {LHCII}. It reproduces the linear absorption, circular dichroism, and 2D spectra at different waiting times. Several components of the energy transport are revealed from theoretical simulations that agree well with the experimental observations.},

Using the dynamics of an exactly-solvable three-level open system as a reference, we show that our approach performs better during the transient evolution, if compared to other approaches like the partial secular master equation or the universal Lindblad equation.

	abstract = {Open quantum systems weakly coupled to the environment are modeled by completely positive, trace preserving semigroups of linear maps. The generators of such evolutions are called Lindbladians. In the setting of quantum many-body systems on a lattice it is natural to consider Lindbladians that decompose into a sum of local interactions with decreasing strength with respect to the size of their support. For both practical and theoretical reasons, it is crucial to estimate the impact that perturbations in the generating Lindbladian, arising as noise or errors, can have on the evolution. These local perturbations are potentially unbounded, but constrained to respect the underlying lattice structure. We show that even for polynomially decaying errors in the Lindbladian, local observables and correlation functions are stable if the unperturbed Lindbladian has a unique fixed point and a mixing time that scales logarithmically with the system size. The proof relies on Lieb–Robinson bounds, which describe a finite group velocity for propagation of information in local systems. As a main example, we prove that classical Glauber dynamics is stable under local perturbations, including perturbations in the transition rates, which may not preserve detailed balance.},

	abstract = {Markovian master equations are a ubiquitous tool in the study of open quantum systems, but deriving them from first principles involves a series of compromises. On the one hand, the Redfield equation is valid for fast environments (whose correlation function decays much faster than the system relaxation time) regardless of the relative strength of the coupling to the system Hamiltonian, but is notoriously non-completely-positive. On the other hand, the Davies equation preserves complete positivity but is valid only in the ultra-weak coupling limit and for systems with a finite level spacing, which makes it incompatible with arbitrarily fast time-dependent driving. Here we show that a recently derived Markovian coarse-grained master equation ({CGME}), already known to be completely positive, has a much expanded range of applicability compared to the Davies equation, and moreover, is locally generated and can be generalized to accommodate arbitrarily fast driving. This generalization, which we refer to as the time-dependent {CGME}, is thus suitable for the analysis of fast operations in gate-model quantum computing, such as quantum error correction and dynamical decoupling. Our derivation proceeds directly from the Redfield equation and allows us to place rigorous error bounds on all three equations: Redfield, Davies, and coarse-grained. Our main result is thus a completely positive Markovian master equation that is a controlled approximation to the true evolution for any time-dependence of the system Hamiltonian, and works for systems with arbitrarily small level spacing. We illustrate this with an analysis showing that dynamical decoupling can extend coherence times even in a strictly Markovian setting.},

	abstract = {We develop from ﬁrst principles Markovian master equations suited for studying the time evolution of a system evolving adiabatically while coupled weakly to a thermal bath. We derive two sets of equations in the adiabatic limit, one using the rotating wave (secular) approximation that results in a master equation in Lindblad form, the other without the rotating wave approximation but not in Lindblad form. The two equations make markedly different predictions depending on whether or not the Lamb shift is included. Our analysis keeps track of the various time and energy scales associated with the various approximations we make, and thus allows for a systematic inclusion of higher order corrections, in particular beyond the adiabatic limit. We use our formalism to study the evolution of an Ising spin chain in a transverse ﬁeld and coupled to a thermal bosonic bath, for which we identify four distinct evolution phases. While we do not expect this to be a generic feature, in one of these phases dissipation acts to increase the ﬁdelity of the system state relative to the adiabatic ground state.},

	abstract = {Much can be learned about molecular aggregates by modeling their fluorescence-type spectra. In this study, we systematically describe the accuracy of various methods for simulating fluorescence-type linear spectra in a dimer system with a complex system–environment interaction, which serves as a model for various molecular aggregates, including most photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes ({LHCs}). We consider the approximate full cumulant expansion ({FCE}), complex time-dependent Redfield ({ctR}), time-independent Redfield, and modified Redfield methods and calculate their accuracy as a function of the site energy gap and coupling, excitonic energy gap, and dipole factor (i.e., type of spectrum). We find that the {FCE} method is the most accurate method for couplings smaller than 300 cm−1 at 300 K, but this method fails for very strong couplings or low temperatures due to inaccurate modeling of the equilibrium initial state. The {ctR} method performs well for the calculation of fluorescence and linear anisotropy spectra but poorer for circularly polarized fluorescence spectra or for all spectra when the coupling is strong (∼100cm−1). The Redfield and modified Redfield methods generally perform much more poorly than the {ctR} and {FCE} methods—especially for small excitonic energy gaps and strong couplings. We show that accurate modeling of the Stokes shift is crucial and present a version of the {ctR} method that treats both the Stokes shift and initial state correctly for the parameter ranges in plant {LHCs}. Apart from the application to {LHCs}, our results will be useful for the spectral characterization and design of organic molecular aggregates.},

	abstract = {Photosynthesis is generally assumed to be initiated by a single photon1-3 from the Sun, which, as a weak light source, delivers at most a few tens of photons per nanometre squared per second within a chlorophyll absorption band1. Yet much experimental and theoretical work over the past 40 years has explored the events during photosynthesis subsequent to absorption of light from intense, ultrashort laser pulses2-15. Here, we use single photons to excite under ambient conditions the light-harvesting 2 ({LH}2) complex of the purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides, comprising B800 and B850 rings that contain 9 and 18 bacteriochlorophyll molecules, respectively. Excitation of the B800 ring leads to electronic energy transfer to the B850 ring in approximately 0.7 ps, followed by rapid B850-to-B850 energy transfer on an approximately 100-fs timescale and light emission at 850-875 nm (refs. 16-19). Using a heralded single-photon source20,21 along with coincidence counting, we establish time correlation\&nbsp;functions for B800 excitation and B850 fluorescence emission and demonstrate that both events involve single photons. We also find that the probability distribution of the number of heralds per detected fluorescence photon supports the view that a single photon can upon absorption drive the subsequent energy transfer and fluorescence emission and hence, by extension, the primary charge separation of photosynthesis. An analytical stochastic model and a Monte Carlo numerical model capture the data, further confirming that absorption of single photons is correlated with emission of single photons in a natural light-harvesting complex.},

Here we present a variation of two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy that is capable of mapping spatially varying differences in excitonic structure, with sensitivity orders of magnitude better than conventional spatially-averaged electronic spectroscopies. The approach performs fluorescence-detection-based fully collinear two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy in a microscope, combining femtosecond time-resolution, sub-micron spatial resolution, and the sensitivity of fluorescence detection. We demonstrate the approach on a mixture of photosynthetic bacteria that are known to exhibit variations in electronic structure with growth conditions. Spatial variations in the constitution of mixed bacterial colonies manifests as spatially varying peak intensities in the measured two-dimensional contour maps, which exhibit distinct diagonal and cross-peaks that reflect differences in the excitonic structure of the bacterial proteins., 2D electronic spectroscopy enables a spatially-averaged view of the electronic structure of a heterogeneous system. Here, the authors extend it to sub-micron resolution and {\textasciitilde}106 times better sensitivity, to resolve spatially varying excitonic structure in a heterogeneous mixture of photosynthetic cells.},

	abstract = {Photosynthesis is a highly optimized process from which valuable lessons can be learned about the operating principles in nature. Its primary steps involve energy transport operating near theoretical quantum limits in efficiency. Recently, extensive research was motivated by the hypothesis that nature used quantum coherences to direct energy transfer. This body of work, a cornerstone for the field of quantum biology, rests on the interpretation of small-amplitude oscillations in two-dimensional electronic spectra of photosynthetic complexes. This Review discusses recent work reexamining these claims and demonstrates that interexciton coherences are too short lived to have any functional significance in photosynthetic energy transfer. Instead, the observed long-lived coherences originate from impulsively excited vibrations, generally observed in femtosecond spectroscopy. These efforts, collectively, lead to a more detailed understanding of the quantum aspects of dissipation. Nature, rather than trying to avoid dissipation, exploits it via engineering of exciton-bath interaction to create efficient energy flow.},

The goal is to give a language to the student in which to speak about quantum physics in more detail, and to start the student on a path of fluency in this language. On our journey we approach questions such as: -- You already know how to calculate the energy eigenstates of a single particle in a simple one-dimensional potential. How can such calculations be generalized to non-trivial potentials, higher dimensions, and interacting particles? -- You have heard that quantum mechanics describes our everyday world just as well as classical mechanics does, but have you ever seen an example where such behavior is calculated in detail and where the transition from classical to quantum physics is evident? -- How can we describe the internal spin structure of particles? How does this internal structure couple to the particles' motion? -- What are qubits and quantum circuits, and how can they be assembled to simulate a future quantum computer?},
